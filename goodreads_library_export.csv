Rob Sheffield shares endearing anecdotes about his first wife Renée throughout the book, and you can absolutely tell he was and still is in awe of her. It's poignant, funny, heartfelt, and a book that I'm sure a lot of people can relate to. After all, I'm pretty sure we can all remember the songs we listened to during the good and bad times in our lives – I might not have cassettes, but I've sure got the Spotify playlists, still! I had an absolute blast exploring the songs on the mixtapes at the beginning of each chapter as they gave me even more of an insight into the stories Rob tells throughout the book.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a five-star read for me!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Many adore this book, say it's life-changing. I can't say the same. <br/><br/>Suicide is a recurring theme in my life, even now. I've got no qualms with admitting it. ""Trivial"" things happen, and I always arrive at the same solution. So I understand the protagonist, Nora. When her cat dies, it's the last straw. But that's the only thing I liked about this book.<br/><br/>From the exposition-laden dialogue to the constant platitudes about living and learning. The writing isn't particularly elegant. Insta-ready mantras clog every page.<br/><br/>Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm cynical about self-kindness. Maybe this book came to me at the wrong time, when ""the life you want to live is the one you choose"" wasn't what I needed to hear. <br/><br/>I'm pained to say I disliked this book, especially when Matt Haig is so open about mental health on his social media. I know it comes from a good place. <br/><br/>It's helped a lot of people, but The Midnight Library by Matt Haig wasn't for me.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
